# Physical AI Foundations

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics curriculum. This module establishes the foundational principles that distinguish physical AI from traditional software-based artificial intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the fundamental differences between embodied and disembodied AI
- Recognize the importance of sensor-actuator loops in physical intelligence
- Appreciate the challenges of real-world uncertainty and noise
- Grasp the concept of sim-to-real transfer

## Module Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from computation in isolation to intelligence that emerges from interaction with the physical world. Unlike chatbots or recommendation systems, physical AI systems must:

1. **Perceive** - Process noisy, continuous sensor data in real-time
2. **Decide** - Make choices under uncertainty with real consequences
3. **Act** - Execute physical movements that affect the environment
4. **Learn** - Adapt to physical constraints and unexpected situations

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience (Python preferred)
- Familiarity with linear algebra concepts
- Understanding of basic probability
