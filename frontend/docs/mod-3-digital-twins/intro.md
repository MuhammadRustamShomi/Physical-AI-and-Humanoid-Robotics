# Digital Twins (Gazebo & Unity)

Module 3 introduces simulation as a critical tool for developing and testing physical AI systems. Digital twins allow you to experiment safely before deploying to real hardware.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Create physics-accurate simulations in Gazebo
- Build photorealistic environments in Unity
- Connect simulators to ROS 2 for testing
- Understand simulation fidelity and its limitations

## Why Simulation?

Simulation accelerates development by:

- **Safety** - Test dangerous scenarios without risk
- **Speed** - Run thousands of trials faster than real-time
- **Cost** - No hardware wear or damage during development
- **Reproducibility** - Repeat exact scenarios for debugging

## Simulation Stack

| Simulator | Strength | Use Case |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Gazebo | Physics accuracy | Dynamics testing |
| Unity | Visual realism | Perception training |
| Isaac Sim | Both + GPU | Production training |

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Modules 1-2
- Basic 3D graphics concepts helpful

## Chapters in This Module

1. [Introduction to Gazebo](./ch-01-gazebo-intro) - Open-source robotics simulation
