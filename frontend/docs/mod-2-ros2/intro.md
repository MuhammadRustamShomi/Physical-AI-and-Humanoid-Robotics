# ROS 2 Nervous System

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the "nervous system" of modern robotic platforms. ROS 2 provides the communication infrastructure that connects sensors, processors, and actuators.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the ROS 2 architecture and design principles
- Master nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Build and deploy ROS 2 packages
- Configure communication for real-time performance

## Why ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the industry standard for robotics development, used by companies from Boston Dynamics to Amazon Robotics. Key advantages include:

- **Real-time capable** - Deterministic communication when needed
- **Security** - Built-in DDS security for production systems
- **Cross-platform** - Runs on Linux, Windows, and embedded systems
- **Modular** - Component-based architecture for reusability

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1
- Linux command line familiarity
- Python and/or C++ programming

## Chapters in This Module

1. [ROS 2 Fundamentals](./ch-01-ros2-fundamentals) - Core concepts and architecture
