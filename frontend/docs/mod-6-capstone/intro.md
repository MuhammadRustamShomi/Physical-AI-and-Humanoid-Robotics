# Conversational Humanoid Capstone

Welcome to the final module! Here you will integrate everything learned across the curriculum to build a conversational humanoid robot system.

## Project Overview

The capstone project combines:

- **Physical AI Foundations** - Embodied reasoning
- **ROS 2** - System integration
- **Digital Twins** - Safe development
- **Isaac Platform** - Training infrastructure
- **VLA Models** - Multimodal intelligence

## Capstone Objectives

By the end of this project, you will have:

1. Designed a humanoid robot architecture
2. Implemented natural language interaction
3. Trained manipulation policies
4. Deployed a working prototype (simulation or physical)
5. Documented your system design

## Project Milestones

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1-2 | System Design | Architecture document |
| 3-4 | Core Integration | ROS 2 + Simulation |
| 5-6 | VLA Training | Working model |
| 7-8 | Deployment | Demo + Report |

## Safety Requirements

:::danger Safety First
All capstone projects involving physical hardware MUST include:
- Emergency stop mechanisms
- Workspace boundary enforcement
- Human proximity detection
- Fail-safe default behaviors

Review the Ethics & Safety constitution principles before proceeding.
